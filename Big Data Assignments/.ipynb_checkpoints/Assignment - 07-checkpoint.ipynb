    "a) Indexing in MongoDB improves query performance by creating an index on a specific field or set of fields. Here's an example Python program that creates an index on a specific field in a MongoDB collection and executes a query using that index:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",

    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "create_index()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Given a MongoDB collection named \"products,\" here's a Python function that searches for products with a specific keyword in the name or description, optimized by adding appropriate indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "def search_products(keyword):\n",

    "# Example usage\n",
    "search_products('electronics')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pymongo` and `cassandra-driver`), and adjust the connection settings, collection/table names, field names, and error handling as per your specific setup.\n",
